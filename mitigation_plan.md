# Mitigation Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Recipe Microservice with the Main Program being developed by my teammate.

### A. For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?

I implemented "Microservice A" for my teammate, **Jia Ma**.

### B. What is the current status of the microservice?

The microservice is **done**. All planned features—recipe scaling, editing, and favoriting—have been fully implemented and are ready for integration. The code is complete and has been tested with a dedicated test client.

### C. If the microservice isn’t done, which parts aren’t done and when will they be done?

Not applicable. The microservice is complete.

### D. How is your teammate going to access your microservice?

They should get the code from my GitHub repository. I will provide them with a link. They will need to run the microservice on their local machine. Instructions for setup and execution are included in the `README.md` file. The service will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5001` by default.

### E. If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do?

### F. If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?

### G. Is there anything else your teammate needs to know?

N/A
